[drm] stuck on render ring
[drm] GPU HANG: ecode 7:0:0x85dffffd, in X [6826], reason: Ring hung, action: reset
[drm] GPU hangs can indicate a bug anywhere in the entire gfx stack, including userspace.
[drm] Please file a _new_ bug report on bugs.freedesktop.org against DRI -> DRM/Intel
[drm] drm/i915 developers can then reassign to the right component if it's not a kernel issue.
[drm] The gpu crash dump is required to analyze gpu hangs, so please always attach it.
